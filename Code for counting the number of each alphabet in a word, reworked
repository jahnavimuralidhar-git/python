'''
Code performing the same function as the code uploaded on 18th September, 2025, but reworked.
The code now will produce output seperately for two words if the two words are seperated by a " " 
EXAMPLE: "Hello to you"
OUTPUT GENERATED:
e : 1
h : 1
l : 2
o : 1
 
o : 1
t : 1
 
o : 1
u : 1
y : 1

The split() function has been used to make this happen.
